##SUMMARY: 
A Ruby on Rails application that randomly cycles through a collection of excerpts from books, quotes, terms and definitions, and short biographies by, from or of feminists, and displays them to the main page.

##PUBLIC SIDE: 
No login is required for the public interface. Visitors to the public side can:
* Refresh the page to see a new item;
* Share that item on Facebook or Twitter;
* Search the entire collection by keyword

##ADMIN SIDE: 
The site also has an extensive administrative backend to maintain and grow the collection of items; administrators are assigned one of three privilege levels:
* Level 1: Administrators can add, edit and delete administrators; add, edit and delete items; add, edit, delete and assign keywords; and see a given administrator's contributions in descending order
* Level 2: Administrators can edit their account; add, edit and delete items; and add, edit, delete and assign keywords
* Level 3: Administrators can edit their account; add and edit items; and add, edit, delete and assign keywords

You can explore the site's back-end functionality with the following guest logins; the linked site is a clone, meant to be tinkered with.

* Email: test1@test.com; password: "test"; level: 1
* Email: test2@test.com; password: "test"; level: 2
* Email: test3@test.com; password: "test"; level: 3
